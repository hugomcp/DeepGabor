Source code for reproducing the experiments described in "DeepGabor: Learning-Based IrisCode Extraction for More Robust Biometric Recognition" 

For around three decades, the Gabor-based IrisCode approach has been known as the gold standard for iris recognition, mainly due to the high  entropy and binary nature sgn() of the resulting signatures. However, it is known that non- linear angular deformations in the iris texture, with  fibers vanishing/appearing in response to pupil dilation/contraction, often lead to bit flipping of some coefficients, which spreads the genuine scores distribution, and increases false rejections.

This paper describes a solution to attenuate this problem, by describing a Deep Learning (DL) framework that: 1) partially emulates the IrisCode  feature encoding phase; and 2) detects the variations in the iris texture that will likely lead to bit flipping, autonomously adapting the filter  configurations used in such cases. Our solution comprises a customised DL architecture that seamlessly integrates the Gabor kernels used extract the IrisCode, and a multi-scale texture analyzer and regressor to extracts the biometric signature. The resulting model can be seen as an adaptive encoder that is fully compatible to the IrisCode approach, while increasing the consistency of the signatures.

Our experiments were conducted in two well known datasets (CASIA-Iris-Lamp and CASIA-Iris-Thousand) and showed a significant decrease of the mean/standard deviation values of the genuines distribution, at expenses of a marginal deterioration of the impostors scores. The resulting decision environments enable to reduce the levels of false rejections with respect to the baseline at most operating levels (e.g., over 50% for 1eâˆ’3 FAR values).
